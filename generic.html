							<p>COVID-19 is a continuous challenge that the world is facing right now. From the beginning of 2020, countries have responded differently towards this pandemic and have used different methods to prevent the spread of disease. The current state of COVID-19 in each country is different at this point in time because of the different actions they have taken thus far. The goal of this project is to forecast the deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, United States, India, Australia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. We hope that by forecasting the data from these nations we can help nations in controlling and decreasing COVID-19 rates. Therefore, the aim of this project is to assess each countryâ€™s performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will evaluate their actions and compare it to the data we have gathered on the number of cases and deaths to determine the ideal future actions to take.  In addition, we intend to assess the effectiveness of each type of policy responding to the pandemic and to help countries perform better during the pandemic in the future by comparing the countries that performed best and worst.</p>
